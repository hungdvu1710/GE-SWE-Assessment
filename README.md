# Question 2
## A
- In 2/15 rounds, there is at least 1 player from Team2 trying to enter the site via the light blue boundary.
- It's up to the coaches, but to me, this isn't a common strategy.

## B
- With the average time when Team 2 in T enters site with at least 2 riflers or SMGs of 83.7s (01:23.7) they tend to enter the site quite soon when they're well-equipped.

## C
- Heatmap of the coordinates of the players in Team2 when they're defending inside BombsiteB as CT side can be found at the file named "3d_heatmap.png"

### We will create an user-friendly interface for our coaching staff to collect and analyze data about the game
- Interactive Dashboard: Develop an interactive web-based dashboard that allows the coaching staff to input their desired parameters and view the corresponding output. The dashboard should be user-friendly and intuitive, requiring minimal technical knowledge to operate. To make this possible, we will need comprehensive details on specific input and output that our coaching staffs require. As the need of data colelction and analysis can grow, we can add more features in the future if necessary. But a simple Interface should be easy to build to meet the needs of our coaching staff.
- Data Visualization: Present the output in a simple and visually appealing manner, utilizing charts, graphs, and tables to effectively communicate the insights derived from the data. This will make it easier for the coaching staff to interpret and analyze the information.
- Documentation and User Guide: Create comprehensive documentation and a user guide that explains the functionalities and features of the dashboard in a step-by-step manner. This documentation should include instructions on how to input parameters, interpret the output, and utilize every feature. This will enable the coaching staff to independently navigate and utilize the dashboard effectively.
